# Reward Wallet Smart Contract

## Project Description

The Reward Wallet Smart Contract is a decentralized achievement and rewards system built on the Soroban platform (Stellar blockchain). This smart contract enables the creation and distribution of achievement-based rewards to users in a transparent and immutable manner. Users can earn rewards by completing various achievements, and their progress is tracked on-chain through individual wallet records. The contract maintains a registry of achievements with associated reward points, allowing administrators to create new achievements while users can claim rewards for their accomplishments.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize digital reward systems by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, verifiable, and decentralized achievement tracking platform. We aim to provide organizations, gaming platforms, educational institutions, and communities with a trustless infrastructure for recognizing and rewarding user accomplishments. By eliminating intermediaries and ensuring immutable record-keeping, we empower users with true ownership of their achievements and rewards, fostering engagement and motivation across various domains.

## Key Features

- **Achievement Creation**: Administrators can create custom achievements with unique identifiers, names, and reward point values
- **Decentralized Reward Distribution**: Automated reward allocation when users complete achievements, eliminating manual intervention
- **User Wallet Tracking**: Each user has an on-chain wallet that tracks total achievements earned, accumulated reward points, and last claim timestamp
- **Transparent Achievement Registry**: All achievements are stored on-chain with unique IDs for easy verification and auditing
- **Authentication Security**: User authentication is required for claiming achievements, ensuring secure reward distribution
- **Persistent Storage**: Achievement and wallet data are stored with extended TTL (Time To Live) for long-term accessibility
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for tracking achievement creation and reward distribution activities
- **Immutable Records**: All transactions and achievements are permanently recorded on the blockchain
